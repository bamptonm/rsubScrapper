# rsubScrapper
Scrape r/xxx to find trending stocks (wallstreetbet, stocks, pennystocks, etc)


You'll need to create app credentials via Reddit and retrieve the client_id and client_secret. 
This was easy enough to do by heading to the reddit app preferences page (https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps), selecting “are you a developer? create an app…”, and entering some info! (Quick note: I used http://localhost:8888/ as my web url)

Code and how to was found at: https://medium.com/@tom.santinelli/scraping-reddits-wall-street-bets-for-popular-stock-tickers-38ed5202affc

All credit goes to tomsant ( https://github.com/tomsant ) I don't know Python and his repo was a great way to get started
